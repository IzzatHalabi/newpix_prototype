How to track Desired room?

Issue:
    Need more distinguishing questions
    Need more accuracy
    Need to add SIBC (M/F)
    Need to restructure retrieving data to Python from database
    Need Roommate concept
    Need to select individual room after Assignment to bigger list
    Gender in Hostels


    Descentralize RoomLimitList
        // Replace with Correct Room Availability
        Use new id for new room (eg: 1:Room 1-A, 2:Room 1-B)
            Need to group together the same room

Current process: 
    Receive weightage from senders
    MCDM all weightages
    List them all based on Descending orders
    Assign them according to the List

Idea Approach:
    May need to increase assess inputs. This technique is suitable for:
        Enable roommate is desirable;
        Enable targeting specific roommate;
        Enable limit based on races/religions;

Arising issue:
    How to tackle overlapping desired room requests?
        (Current Solution)
            Set another set of processing queue (assign first) 
            Get Normalize Weightage of users' inputs
            Sort descending order on Desired Room Requests based Normalized Weightage
            When a student highly focusing on the desired room instead of the preferences,
                the student will be queued amongst those of which are almost guaranteed for the room.

Idea ground:
    Overlapping room requests
        Why?
            People choosing the same room.
            The selected room still available although other users have chosen it.



Consideration:
    Assume all rooms are available

    Group MCDM


Survey
    preferences
        Price
        Roommate
        Roommate Race
        etc...
        (if possible) air-cond(price increase)
    Preferable Villages
        V1 to SIBC
    If you are unable to get your desired room, which result you prefer?
        A room from the same village
        A room from another village but based on your desired preferences
    (Optional) What is the most preferable village for you? Why?


Algorithm  
    Set Reference (collected from Database)
    Get preference result into list

    For each process
        Run special process 
        Select rooms( based on preference ) into a list : Filter
        Compare selected rooms with the remaining list
        Store compared list into checklist
