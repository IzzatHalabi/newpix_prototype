How to track Desired room?

Issue:
    Need more distinguishing questions
    Need more accuracy

Current process: 
    Receive weightage from senders
    MCDM all weightages
    List them all based on Descending orders
    Assign them according to the List

Idea Approach:
    May need to increase assess inputs. This technique is suitable for:
        Enable roommate is desirable;
        Enable targeting specific roommate;
        Enable limit based on races/religions;

Arising issue:
    How to tackle overlapping desired room requests?
        (Current Solution)
            Set another set of processing queue (assign first) 
            Set a threshold
            When a student highly focusing on the desired room instead of the preferences,
                with percentage above the threshold,
                the student will be queued amongst those of which are almost guaranteed for the room.

Idea ground:
    Overlapping room requests
        Why?
            People choosing the same room.
            The selected room still available although other users have chosen it.



Consideration:
    Assume all rooms are available
